Welcome to :code:`dust_mie`'s documentation!
===============================================

:code:`mie_dust` is a simple wrapper for `miepython`_.

.. _miepython: https://miepython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

It evaluates the complex indices of refraction for several astrophysical dust particles as well as can average optical properties over a distribution of particle sizes.

The raw code is accessible at https://github.com/eas342/dust_mie

Thanks to Graham Lee for compiling the optical coefficients and for Jake Taylor for sharing the data and how to use them.
